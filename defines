PEXT                  #Allow non-zero external pressure 
JEANSSOFT             #Calculate presure floor to keep jeans length larger than softening or sph h (default is just sph h)
JEANSSOFTONLY         #Calculate presure floor to keep jeans length larger than softening only
INFLOWOUTFLOW         #Enable inflow/outflow boundary conditions
PARTICLESPLIT         #Particles will now divide if they get too heavy
OUTURBDRIVER          #Drive turbulence as in Price & Federrath 2010 with OU variables
ROT_FRAME             #Use a rotating reference frame with rotation rate given by dOmega

## INITIAL CONDITION BUILDING
GLASS                 #Use this to damp for glass initial conditions
GLASSZ                #Use this to damp for glass IC in z direction
